The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red;
}

#id-div {
  color: green;
}

#id-div.special-div {
  color: purple; /* This selector is more specific and will override the others */
}
```

The error might arise from unexpected behavior due to the combination of class and ID selectors.  A developer might assume that `#id-div` would always take precedence, but the `#id-div.special-div` selector is even more specific due to the combination, resulting in `purple` being the final color.  This can cause confusion and debugging challenges if not anticipated.
