The following CSS code demonstrates a solution where the selector specificity is clarified to control the color of the elements.  We made the `#id-div` the most specific selector, so it will take precedence.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red;
}

#id-div {
  color: green; /* Will override the others */
}

#id-div.special-div {
  color: purple;
}
```
Alternatively, you could refactor your CSS to avoid such complex overlapping selectors.
